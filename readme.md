How to build & run: (requires JDK 14 and Maven)
- Run `mvn clean javafx:run` from the project directory

Some external resources are required to properly run the application:
- GermaNet
- The [interlingual index](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/ressources/lexica/germanet/description/interlingual-index/) for GermaNet
- [Frequency lists](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/ressources/lexica/germanet/applications-tools/) for GermaNet

The path to these resources can be specified in `src/main/java/logic/ResourcePaths.java`.
